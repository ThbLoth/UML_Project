# UML_Project
This is the repository of the CONCOVHEALTH application, created by
# ADRIEN CAILLOT, THIBAULT LOTH, PIERRE-LOUIS CRETINON, VINCENT EUNG, THEOPHILE BAPTISTE-BOUGON
and mainly developped by
# THIBAULT LOTH (FRONT & BACK), ADRIEN CAILLOT (FRONT) AND PIERRE-LOUIS CRETINON (FRONT).

The repository has been updated once the programm was nearly finished, we developped all the frond-end by our sides,
then we merged all the front to then developp the back-end.
